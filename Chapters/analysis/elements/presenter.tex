\subsection{The Presenter Element}

\evaluateElementTable{Presenter}{tab_convergence_presenter}{ \addEvalRow{Data &
    \noConvergence &  There is no convergence between the Presenter element of \gls{ca} and
    the Data element of \gls{ns}, and no manifestations are found in the artifact.}

    \addEvalRow{Task & \npartialConvergence &  The Presenter is responsible for preparing the
    ViewModel on behalf of the Controller and can be considered a task Element with a
    narrow scope. Because of this narrow scope, the elements are not fully
    interchangeable. Code Listing \ref{list_createentitypresenter} illustrated the inner
    workings of a Presenter \parencite{koks_createentitypresenter_2023}. }

    \addEvalRow{Flow & \npartialConvergence & Presenters can handle multiple Tasks when this
    is required. in this case there is also some convergence between the Presenter Element
    of \gls{ca} with the Flow Element of \gls{ns}.}

    \addEvalRow{Connector & \noConvergence & There is no convergence between the Presenter
    element of \gls{ca} and the Connector element of \gls{ns}, and no manifestations are
    found in the artifact.}
    
    \addEvalRow{Trigger & \noConvergence & There is no convergence between the Presenter
    element of \gls{ca} and the Trigger element of \gls{ns}, and no manifestations are
    found in the artifact.} }
