\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}

\enquote{\emph{Pantha Rhei}} is, according to \emph{Plato}, one of the famous
philosophical statements first described by the Greek philosopher
\emph{Heraclitus}\footnote{\url{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/}}.
Translated as \enquote{everything flows} this statement is an unambiguous commitment to
ubiquitous dynamics of everything that exists. \enquote{Life is flux}, one of the
constants in life is change.

In the realms of Software Engineering, the \enquote{laws of software evolution}
\parencite[]{lehman_programs_1980} refers to a series of laws described by
\citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980}. With these Laws, he describes the balance between the
forces driving new developments on the one hand (a change) and the forces that slow down
progress on the other hand. Based on \emph{Heraclitus} philosophical statement, we know
software engineering projects will frequently be subjected to change, probably due to
changing functional requirements and technological progress. As these changes emerge, the
complexity of these projects will gradually increase over time due to the increasing
number of combinatorial effects. Eventually, this will render the system obsolete,
according to \citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980} \parencite[]{lehman_programs_1980}.

As the competitive environments of contemporary organizations are changing continuously,
the speed at which changes emerge is also increasing. IT organizations are
attempting to cope with this trend by adopting agility and maturing their agile practices
\parencite[]{2024_SIM_key_issues_and_trends}. Therefore, agility has been defined as a measure for
contemporary organizations to adapt to new environments and cope with rapid change
\parencite[]{neumann_strategic_1994}.
