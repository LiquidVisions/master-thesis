\chapter{Theoretical background} \label{chap:theoreticalbackground} 

\gls{ns} is a software development approach that prioritizes achieving software stability
through the use of standardized, modular components and interfaces. This theory is
informed by several scientific disciplines, including systems theory, mathematics, and
computer science, as well as some other software development approaches such as agile
development and domain-driven design.

The goal of this thesis is to investigate whether the philosophy of \gls{ca}
aligns with the goals of \gls{ns}. To do so, it is essential to have a
comprehensive understanding of software stability and the key concepts, principles, and
architectures that impact software stability.

This chapter begins by examining the concepts of software stability, evolvability, and
modularity, highlighting their significance in achieving software stability in \gls{ns}.
This is followed by a brief overview of the design theorems and proposed architecture of
\gls{ns}.

The subsequent sections of the thesis explore the fundamental principles that underlie
\gls{ca}, as well as its proposed architecture designs. Finally, the thesis
concludes by discussing which aspects of \gls{ca} align with the principles of
\gls{ns} and contribute to achieving software stability in this approach.
