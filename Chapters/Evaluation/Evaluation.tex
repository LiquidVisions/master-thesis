\chapter{Evaluation results} \label{chap_evaluation}

In this chapter, we will compare the two approaches to architectural design: \gls{ca} and
\gls{ns}. We will examine how these approaches converge and affect software design on the
artifacts. First, in Section \ref{sec_converging_principles}, we will compare the
principles of \gls{ca} with the principles of \gls{ns}. Then, we will compare the design
elements of the two approaches in section \ref{sec_converging_elements}. Both sections
will showcase real-world examples from the Artifacts to illustrate theoretical
manifestations.
