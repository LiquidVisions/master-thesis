One of the constants in life is the idea everything in life is constantly in motion,
nothing ever stays the same. Plato states that \enquote*{Patha Rhei} is one of the famous
philosophical statements first described by the Greek philosopher
\emph{Heraclitus}\footnote{\url{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/}}.
His statement unambiguously describes the dynamics of everything that exists. The
\enquote{flux}, or \emph{change} is one of the constants in life. 

According to most scholars, this most certainly also applies to modern corporate
environments where change is continuously introduced at an ever-increasing pace. These
changes lead to an evolution of requirements impacting the evolvability, stability and
quality of software artifacts like Information Systems.

The \enquote{laws of software evolution} \parencite[]{lehman_programs_1980} refers to a
series of laws described by \citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980}. He describes the balance
between the forces driving new requirements on the one hand, and the forces that slow down
progress on the other hand. In other words: changing software leads to deterioration of
stability and evolvability, possibly with a negative effect on the desired quality
of these software systems. 

More than a half of century of software engineering-, and architecture practices show that
the complexity of these software artifacts gradually increases over time. Eventually, this
will render most of the software artifacts obsolete, according to
\citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980} \parencite[]{lehman_programs_1980}.

Over time there have been many attempts to solve the deterioration of Software Artifact,
some of which with scientific backgrounds. Even before the publication of
\citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980} laws of evolution, McIlroy proposed a vision where the
systematic reuse of software building blocks leads to negative programming practices where
software changes eventually lead to a reduction of complexity
\parencite*{p_naur_nato_1968}. Parnas continued with the principle of information hiding
which can be considered to be the foundation of modular software architectures.

Over the last decades, several programming paradigms had had a significant effect on the
modularity, stability and evolvability of software systems. Procedural programming was one
of the first paradigms to emerge that supported modularity in its constructs. This was
then followed by object-oriented with support for encapsulation and polymorphism.
functional programming. All of which had a significant impact on modern programming
languages like Java and C\#. The constructs of these programming languages significantly
enhanced the capabilities of modular and evolvable software architectures.
