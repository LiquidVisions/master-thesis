\section{An analysis of Elements} \label{sec_converging_elements}

In this section, we will apply a systematic cross-referencing approach to assess the level
of convergence between the elements of both \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}. Along with a brief
explanation, the level of convergence is denoted as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l l p{0.57\linewidth}} 
        
    Strong convergence & \fullConvergence & Both elements have a high level of similarity or
    are closely related in terms of their purpose, structure, or functionality.\\

    Supports convergence & \npartialConvergence &  Both elements have some similarities or share
    certain aspects in their purpose, structure, or functionality, but they are not identical
    or directly interchangeable.\\

    No or weak convergence & \noConvergence &  The elements are unrelated or have no significant
    similarities in terms of purpose, structure, or functionality.\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
