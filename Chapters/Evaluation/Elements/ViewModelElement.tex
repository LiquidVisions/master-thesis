\subsection{Converging the ViewModel element} \label{converging_viewmodel_element}

The following \gls{ns} elements are convergent with the \emph{ViewModel} element of
\gls{ca}. The \emph{Task}, \emph{Flow}, \emph{Connector} and \emph{Trigger} elements are
in no way convergent as they differ in the perspective of structure, intent, purpose and
functionality.

        Data & \someConvergence & The \emph{ViewModel} and \gls{ns} \emph{Data} element
        convergent to a limited degree. Both are involved in defining the structure of
        data used in the system. This could include required information about attributes
        and relationships. Additionally, the \emph{ViewModel} could represent information that is
        specifically intended for the representation of behavior for a user interface. \\
