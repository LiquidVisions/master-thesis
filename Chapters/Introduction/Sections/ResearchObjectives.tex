\section{Research Objectives} \label{sec_research_objectives}

In this Design Science research, the focus shifts from a research question toward
research objectives. The following objectives apply to this research.

\subsection*{Objective 1: The expander artifact}
A C\# artifact that consists of a source code expander and some helper classes to
generate the second \emph{expanded} artifact. The artifact supports the harvesting and
rejuvenation of custom code snippets on the expanded artifact so that regenerations do not
have a loss of implementations on the expanded artifact. The expander artifact is entirely
based on the design principles of \gls{ca}.

Chapter \ref{sec_generator_artifact} entirely describes the expander artifact.

\subsection*{Objective 2: The expanded artifact}
This artifact is an entirely working restful API, that is based on ASP.NET and C\#. It has
essential CRUD support. The artifact has been generated by the \emph{expander} and has
been enriched with custom code snippets to comply with the initial requirements.
The expanded artifact is entirely based on the design principles of \gls{ca}.

Chapter \ref{sec_generator_artifact} entirely describes the expander artifact.
