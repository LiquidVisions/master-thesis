\subsection{The Boundary Element}

\evaluateElementTable{Boundary}{tab_convergence_boundary}{
    \addEvalRow{Data & \noAlignment &  The Boundary and Data elements are not convergent, as the
        Boundary element is focused on separating concerns between components, while the
        Data element of \gls{ns} represents a domain object.}

    \addEvalRow{ Task & \noAlignment &  The Boundary and Flow Task element are not convergent, However,
        the Boundary element can be used in a Task element to ensure a clear separation
        of concerns between different modules.}

    \addEvalRow{ Flow & \partialAlignment & The Boundary and Flow element are not convergent, However, the
        Boundary element can be used in a Flow element to ensure a clear separation of
        concerns between different modules.}

    \addEvalRow{Connector & \fullAlignment & The Boundary and Connector elements have a strong convergence,
        as both are involved in communication between components and help ensure loose
        coupling between these components.}
    
    \addEvalRow{ Trigger & \noAlignment & The Boundary and Trigger element are not convergent, as the
        Trigger in \gls{ns} is about event-based execution of Tasks, whilst the Boundary in
        \gls{ca} ensures the separation of concerns between components of the system.}
