\chapter{Conclusions and discussion} \label{chap_conclusions}

This thesis embodies a multidimensional exploration into the convergence of \gls{ca} with
\gls{ns}. We have drawn upon the author's firsthand experience in designing Software
Architectures used rigorous theoretical research. Additionally We created practical and
working Software Artifacts. The primary objective was to study the convergence between
\gls{ca} and \gls{ns}, by analyzing their principles and design elements through theory
and practice. This Chapter will summarize the findings into a research conclusion.

\section{Conclusion}

A noteworthy distinction between \gls{ns} and \gls{ca} lies in their foundational roots.
\gls{ns} is a product of computer science research built upon formal theories and
principles derived from rigorous scientific investigation. Although, throughout this
thesis, \gls{ns} is referred to as a development approach, it is actually a part of
Computer Science.

Stability and evolvability are concepts not directly referenced in the literature of
\gls{ca}, but this design approach very much alings with the goal of
\textcite[31]{mannaert_normalized_2016}. Clearly depicted in Table
\ref{tab_convergence_principles_summarized} The attentive reader surely observes the
shared emphasis on modularity and the separation of concerns, as all SOLID principles have
a stong convergence with \gls{soc}. Both approaches attempt to achieve low coupling and
high cohesion. In addition, \gls{ca} add the dimensions of dependency management as
usefull measure to improve maintainability and manage dependencies in a modular
architecture.

The Transparency of Data versions appears to be underrepresented in the SOLID principles
of \gls{ca}. \gls{dvt} is primarily supported by the \gls{srp} of \gls{ca}, as evidenced
by the presence of ViewModels, RequestModels, ResponseModels, and Entities in the
Artifact. It is worth noting this separation of concerns on an ontological level is an
integral part of the design elements of \gls{ca}. While \gls{ca} does address \gls{dvt}
through the \gls{srp}, a more comprehensive representation of the underlying idea of
\gls{dvt} within the principles of \gls{ca} will likely improve the convergence of
\gls{ca} with \gls{ns}, potentially improving the stability and evolvability of Software
Systems based on \gls{ca}.

As described in sections \fullref{combinatorics}, the underrepresentation of \gls{dvt} has
led to significant combinatorial effects in some parts of the artifacts. These
combinatorial effects are also be attributed to the author's inexperience in creating
systems that enable code generation through expansion while maintaining stability on
templates and craftings. When Data Version Transparency was better represented in the
principles of \gls{ca}, the severity of the combinatorial effects would have most likely
been less.

As indicated in Table \ref{tab_convergence_elements_summarized}, \gls{ca} seems to lack a
strong foundation for receiving external triggers in it's desing phylosophy. This is
partially represented by the Controller element, however this element tends to be use for
web enabled environments like websites and Restful APIs. This may result in a less
comprehensive approach to receiving external triggers across various technologies or
systems.

The most notable difference between \gls{ca} and \gls{ns} lies in their approach to
handling state. \gls{ca} does not explicitly address state management in its principles or
design elements. At the same time, \gls{ns} provides the principle of Separation of State,
ensuring that state changes within a Software System are stable and evolvable. This
principle can be crucial in developing scalable and high-performance systems, as it
isolates state changes from the rest of the system, reducing the impact of state-related
dependencies and side effects. 

The findings can only leads to the conclusion that the convergence between \gls{ca} and
\gls{ns} is incomplete because \gls{ca} needs specific state management principles. As a
result, \gls{ca} cannot fully ensure stable and evolvable software artifacts as defined by
\gls{ns}.
