\chapter{Research approach} \label{chap:research_approach}

As described in the chapters \ref{chap:generator_artifact} and
\ref{chap:generated_artifact} there are two main artifacts as part of this design science
research. The first artifact is the generator artifact that is responsible for generating
the second one, the generated artifact. Both artifacts are designed purely based on the
principles and design philosophy of \acrshort{ca}. In order to research to what extent the
\acrshort{ca} converges with the principles of \acrshort{ns} improvements will be made to
the generator artifact in multiple iterations.

Each iteration is a single modification, representing a feature that will improve the
generated artifact. For each feature that will be applied, the actual changes are compared
with the anticipated changes. When the actual changes exceed the anticipated changes,
then there is a combinatorial effect.
