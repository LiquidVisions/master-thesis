\section{Research Design Decision} \label{sec_research_design_decisions}

In accordance to chapter \ref{sec_research_requirements}, the following design decisions
have been made to be able to analyze the stability and the evolvability of both
of the artifacts.

\subsection{Fulfilling Research Requirement 1}
The following Data entities will be created as part of the initial versions of both
artifacts. A full description of the data entities and their relations towards each other
can be reviewed in chapter \fullref{sec_artifact_meta_model}. A description of all
attributes are included.
