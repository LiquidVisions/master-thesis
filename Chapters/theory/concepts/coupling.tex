\subsection{Low Coupling} \label{subsec_on_coupling}

Coupling is an essential concept in software engineering related to the degree of
interdependence among software modules and components. High coupling between modules
indicates the strength of their relationship, whereby a high level of coupling implies a
significant degree of interdependence. Conversely, low coupling signifies a weaker
relationship between modules, where modifications in one module are less likely to impact
others. Although not always possible, the level of coupling between the various modules of
the system should be kept to a bare minimum. Both \textcite[23]{mannaert_normalized_2016}
and \textcite[130]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} agree with the idea that modules should be
coupled as loosely as possible
