\subsection{The executer object} \label{subsec:IExecutionInteractorObject}

An important implementation that facilitates a high degree of cohesion, whilst maintaining
low coupling and adhering to the \gls{srp} principle is the use of the
\citecode{koks_iexecutioninteractor_2023} interface. The generation process is designed to
execute \enquote{tasks} in a predefined order. By using the
\code{koks_iexecutioninteractor_2023} it is possible to design each of the tasks as
separate classes, fully complying, or enabling all of the \gls{solid} principles. The

As depicted in listing \ref{SipCodeGeneratorInteractor}, this design leads to a cohesive
design where all tasks are gracefully executed from a single point in the application.
