    & Both elements represent data objects that are part of the ontology or data schema of
    the  and typically include attributes and relationship information. While both can
    contain a complete set of attributes and relationships, the Data Element of \gls{ns}
    may also be tailored to serve a specific set of information required for a single task
    or use case. In \gls{ca}, these type of Data Elements are explicitly specified as
    ViewModels, RequestModels or ResponseModels. Code Listing \ref{list_entity}
    illustrates an example of an Entity in a way that is very similar to the Data Element
    from \gls{ns} \parencite{koks_entity_2023}}
