\subsection{On the emergence of element} \label{subsec:ns_elements} 

\textbf{Data Element}\\
This is an object that represents a piece of data in the system. Data elements are used to
pass information between processing functions and other objects. In Normalized Systems,
data elements are typically standardized to ensure consistency across the system.

\textbf{Flow Element}\\
This object represents the flow of control through the system. It determines the order in
which processing functions are executed and can be used to handle error conditions or
other exceptional cases.

\textbf{Connector Element}\\
This object is used to connect different parts of the system together. Connectors can be
used to link processing functions, data elements, and other objects, allowing them to work
together seamlessly.

\textbf{Task Element}\\
This is an object that represents a specific task or action in the system. Tasks can be
composed of one or more processing functions and can be used to represent complex
operations within the system.
