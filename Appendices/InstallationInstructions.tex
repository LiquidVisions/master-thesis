\section{Prerequisits} \label{appendix:installation_prerequisits} 

\subsection*{Create output folder}
Create an output folder so that Pantha Rhei:
\begin{itemize}
    \item has a location where to find the required expanders.
    \item has a location where the log files are stored.
    \item has a location where the result of the generation processes can be stored.
\end{itemize}

The location of the output folder is irrelevant.

\subsection*{Create the nuget.config file}
Add a nuget.config file to the output folder with the following content:
\lstinputlisting[
    caption={The content of the nuget.config file},
    label={list:nugetconfig}]
    {Snippets/nuget.config}

\subsection*{Install the Expanders}
Click the following link and download the required expanders. The expander contains the
required logic and templates in order for Pantha Rhei to execute the code generation process.

Create a subfolder \emph{Expanders} in the output folder created in the first step. Extract
each of the expanders in their own folder in the \emph{Expanders} folder.

When following the previous steps you should have the following folder structure
available:

\begin{forest}
    for tree={
      font=\ttfamily,
      grow'=0,
      child anchor=west,
      parent anchor=south,
      anchor=west,
      calign=first,
      inner xsep=7pt,
      edge path={
        \noexpand\path [draw, \forestoption{edge}]
        (!u.south west) +(7.5pt,0) |- (.child anchor) pic {folder} \forestoption{edge label};
      },
      % style for your file node 
      file/.style={edge path={\noexpand\path [draw, \forestoption{edge}]
        (!u.south west) +(7.5pt,0) |- (.child anchor) \forestoption{edge label};},
        inner xsep=2pt,font=\small\ttfamily
                   },
      before typesetting nodes={
        if n=1
          {insert before={[,phantom]}}
          {}
      },
      fit=band,
      before computing xy={l=15pt},
    }  
    [PanthaRhei.Output
    [Expanders
        [.Templates]
    ]
    [nuget.config, file]
  ]
\end{forest}

\section{Installing Pantha Rhei} \label{appendix:installing_pantha_rhei} 
Run the following command to install Pantha Rhei.
\lstinputlisting[
    caption={The install command},
    label={list:install-command}]
    {Snippets/dotnet-install-command.txt}

Pantha Rhei is now ready for use.
