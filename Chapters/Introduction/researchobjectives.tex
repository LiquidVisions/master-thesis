\section{Research Objectives} \label{sec_research_objectives}

In this Design Science Research, we will shift the focus from Research Questions to
Research Objects. The primary goal of this research is to determine the degree of
convergence of \gls{ca} with the \gls{ns} Theory. In order to achieve this goal, the
research is divided into the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Literature Analysis} \newline
    Conduct a literature review of \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}, focusing on their
    fundamental elements, principles, and real-world case studies. This review will
    provide a solid foundation for understanding the underlying concepts and their
    practical implications.
    
    \item \textbf{Architectural Desing} \newline
    Create an Architectural Design fully and solely based on \gls{ca}. Implement the
    findings of the Literature Review in the Design. This design will be the basis for
    the Artifact Development.

    \item \textbf{Artifact Development} \newline
    Construct two artifacts that facilitates the study on the convergence
    between \gls{ca} and \gls{ns} Theories.
    \begin{enumerate}[label*={\arabic*.}]
        
        \item \textbf{Expander framework \& Clean Architecture Expander} \newline        
        These two components will be designed and implemented  based on the \gls{ca}
        design. The Clean Architecture Expander will enable the parameterized
        instantiation of software systems that adhere to the principles and design of
        \gls{ca}. The Expander framework serves as a supporting system for the expander,
        loading and orchestrating dependencies and models and executing the expander.
        
        \item \textbf{Expanded Clean Architecture artifact} \newline
        The expanded artifact will facilitate the analysis of a RESTful API implementation
        and its convergence with the \gls{ca} principles and design.
        
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Analysis of combinatorics} \newline
    Examine the artifacts for actual or potential combinatorial effects to determine
    whether \gls{ca} and \gls{ns} converge. The fundamental principles and architecture of
    \gls{ca} are taken into account while conducting the analysis.
\end{enumerate}
