\section{Introducing Normalized Systems Theorems}

Normalized Systems theorems is a scientific approach to creating software systems based on
the laws for software evolvability. These theorems have resulted in a documented track
record of achieving software stability. Effectively, it reduces the number and impact of
combinatorial effects in the source code. Combinatorial effects occur when the impact of a
change is dependent on the size of the information systems.

\citeauthor[]{mannaert_normalized_2009} have formulated the theorem of Normalized Systems
as prescriptive structures (elements) that lead to a modular architecture with low
coupling and high cohesion. The resulting software architecture will be designed to cope
with future change \parencites[]{mannaert_normalized_2009}.
