\section{Introduction to Clean Architecture} \label{sec_into_ca}

\gls{ca} is the accumulation of more than half a century of coding, designing, and
architecting software systems by \citeauthor*[]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018}. The book aims
for a software architecture that minimizes the human resources required to build and
maintain the information system. \gls{ca} has a prescribed design of software elements
that will lead to a modular architecture with low coupling and high cohesion.
Additionally, the book refers to a set of design principles that prescribes how those
elements should be structured or interact with each other.
