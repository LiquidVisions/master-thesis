In this paper, we undertake a systematic review to obtain an overview of the existing studies in promoting software evolvability at architectural level. The search strategy identified 58 studies that were catalogued as primary studies for this review after using multi-step selection process. The studies are classified into five main categories of themes, including techniques that support quality considerations during software architecture design, architectural quality evaluation, economic valuation, architectural knowledge management and modeling techniques. The review investigates what is currently known about architecting software evolvability at architecture level. Implications for research and practice are presented.},

Normalized Systems (NS) theory attempts to build highly evolvable software systems by using systems theory as its theoretical underpinning. A modeling method which supports the identification of the NS elements, required for building NS sofware in practice, is currently missing. Therefore, the paper introduces an approach for creating both data models and processing models in the context of NS, as well as their integration. It is discussed how these models can be taken as the input for the actual creation of evolutionary prototypes by using an earlier developed supporting tool. The modeling approach and its suitability for feeding the tool are evaluated to discover their current strengths and weaknesses.},

  abstract = {New technical and business opportunities lead to the adoption of new information systems. Integrating these new systems with the existing application landscape poses many challenges, especially when legacy systems are involved. These systems may rely on completely different architectures or assumptions regarding functionality. Normalized Systems Theory addresses this issue by stating that information systems should behave as stable systems. It identifies the main obstacle to achieving stability, so-called combinatorial effects, and proposes four design theorems to avoid these combinatorial effects. Based on these theorems, a set of exemplary software elements are created which can be used to generate applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the real-world usage of these software elements in legacy integration projects by describing four case studies. From a theoretical perspective, these cases validate the theorybased approach of Normalized Systems Theory. From a practical perspective, these cases demonstrate how adoption of Normalized Systems software could be approached: first, by integrating existing systems, and second, by building future applications adhering to the theory.},

  abstract = {Several frameworks have been proposed to define design science and design theory. For this reason, positioning a research stream within both paradigms has become a difficult exercise. In this paper, the Normalized Systems (NS) theory is positioned within design science and design theory, in particular the design theory framework formulated by Gregor \& Jones (2007). Normalized Systems theory has been proposed as a way to cope with the ever increasingly agile environment to which organizations and their software applications need to adapt. The results of positioning NS within the presented framework for design theories show that NS almost fully incorporates all components of the design theory anatomy. The application of NS theory to other fields is also discussed. By positioning Normalized System theory within design science and design theory, we also believe to contribute to the definition of both fields in this paper.},

  abstract = {The emerging field of enterprise engineering provides a promising outlook for positioning relevant research. Enterprise Architecture frameworks which are frequently used in practice, but are often criticized from a research perspective, can be positioned in this field. The challenge for the enterprise engineering field is to provide a framework to improve such frameworks using a rigorous scientific approach. This paper aims to contribute to addressing this challenge by proposing components for a research framework which focuses on applying engineering insights to enterprise architecture. It first explores how current enterprise architecture frameworks handle issues relevant for engineering (i.e., complexity, change and integration). It then introduces additional components which could contribute towards a more systematic approach. These components are derived from the way the Normalized Systems Theory was developed, and successfully introduced engineering standards into the design software architecture.},

Normalized Systems Theory (NST) aims to create software systems exhibiting a proven degree of evolvability. A software implementation exists to create skeletons of Normalized Systems (NS) applications, based on automatic code generation. This paper describes how the NS model representation, and the corresponding code generation, has been made meta-circular, and presents its detailed architecture. It is argued that this feature may be crucial to improve the productivity of metaprogramming, as it enables scalable collaboration based on two-sided interfaces. Some preliminary results from applying this approach in practice are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy. The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer. They apply it quite broadly to include database schemas, test plans, the build system, even documentation.  When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync. Besides using methods and subroutines in their code, Thomas and Hunt rely on code generators, automatic build systems, and scripting languages to observe the DRY principle across layers.},

  abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

Martin offers direct, no-nonsense answers to key architecture and design questions like: What are the best high level structures for different kinds of applications, including web, database, thick-client, console, and embedded apps? What are the core principles of software architecture? What is the role of the architect, and what is he/she really trying to achieve? What are the core principles of software design? How do designs and architectures go wrong, and what can you do about it? What are the disciplines and practices of professional architects and designers? Clean Architecture is essential reading for every software architect, systems analyst, system designer, and software manager -- and for any programmer who aspires to these roles or is impacted by their work},

  abstract = {Malcolm Douglas McIlroy (born 1932) is a mathematician, engineer, and programmer. As of 2019 he is an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College. McIlroy is best known for having originally proposed Unix pipelines and developed several Unix tools, such as spell, diff, sort, join, graph, speak, and tr. He was also one of the pioneering researchers of macro processors and programming language extensibility. He participated in the design of multiple influential programming languages, particularly PL/I, SNOBOL, ALTRAN, TMG and C++. His seminal work on software componentization and code reuse makes him a pioneer of component-based software engineering and software product line engineering.},

  abstract = {In computer science, separation of concerns is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections. Each section addresses a separate concern, a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as "the details of the hardware for an application", or as specific as "the name of which class to instantiate". A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding. Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).Separation of concerns results in more degrees of freedom for some aspect of the program's design, deployment, or usage. Common among these is increased freedom for simplification and maintenance of code. When concerns are well-separated, there are more opportunities for module upgrade, reuse, and independent development. Hiding the implementation details of modules behind an interface enables improving or modifying a single concern's section of code without having to know the details of other sections and without having to make corresponding changes to those other sections. Modules can also expose different versions of an interface, which increases the freedom to upgrade a complex system in piecemeal fashion without interim loss of functionality.Separation of concerns is a form of abstraction. As with most abstractions, separating concerns means adding additional code interfaces, generally creating more code to be executed. So despite the many benefits of well-separated concerns, there is often an associated execution penalty.},

  abstract = {SOLID (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion) is een acroniem dat gebruikt wordt in verband met het programmeren van computers. Ze werd bedacht door Michael Feathers voor de eerste vijf principes die Robert C. Martin aangaf aan het begin van de jaren 2000 De afkorting staat voor de vijf belangrijkste principes in het object-georiënteerd programmeren. Deze principes samen maken het waarschijnlijker dat een programmeur een systeem zal maken dat duurzamer is en gemakkelijk te onderhouden of uit te breiden. De SOLID-principes maken deel uit van een meer globale strategie van agile ontwikkeling en adaptief programmeren.},
