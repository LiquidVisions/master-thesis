\subsection{Screaming Architecture}

\Citeauthor{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} adopts this concept of Screaming Architecture from
\textcite{jacobson_object-oriented_1992}, who points out that Software Architecture are
structures that supports Use Cases of a Software System.
\textcite[195]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} builds on that idea describing that Software
Architectures should emphasize the intent, theme and purpose of the System, rather than
being dictated by frameworks, technology, and delivery mechanisms.
