\subsection{Interface Segregation Principle}

\evaluatePrincipleTable{\gls{isp}}{table_isp_convergence}{ 
    
\addEvalRow{\gls{soc} & \fullConvergence & The \gls{isp} strongly converges with the
\gls{soc} principle, as both emphasize the importance of modularity and the separation of
concerns. \gls{isp} states that clients should not be forced to depend on implementation
they do not use, promoting the creation of smaller, focused interfaces. Listing
\ref{list_ispexample} shows that each \gls{crud} operation has its own interface
\parencite{koks_crudgateways_2023}.}
    
\addEvalRow{\gls{dvt} & \noConvergence & The \gls{isp} does not relate to the \gls{dvt}
principle. The convergence of both principles is weak, and no manifestations are found in
the artifacts.}
    
\addEvalRow{\gls{avt} & \npartialConvergence & The convergence between \gls{isp} and
\gls{avt} arises from the emphasis of \gls{isp} on creating targeted interfaces tailored
to specific needs. Smaller interfaces can enhance modularity and minimize unwanted side
effects when modifying Actions in the software system, positively impacting the
implementation of the \gls{avt}. For example, modifications in Actions are likely to have
a limited impact. However, adhering to \gls{isp} is not a guarantee for \gls{avt}.} 
    
\addEvalRow{\gls{sos} & \noConvergence & The \gls{isp} does not relate to the \gls{sos}
principle. The convergence of both principles is weak, and no manifestations are found in
the artifacts.}
