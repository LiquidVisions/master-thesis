\subsubsection{The Single Responsibility Principle} \label{subsubsec_srp}

This principle has gone through several iterations of the formal definition. The final
definition of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is: \textit{a module should be
responsible to one, and only one, actor} (Robert C. Martin, 2018, p. 82). The word actor
in this statement refers to all the users and stakeholders represented by the (functional)
requirements. The modularity concept in this definition is described by
\textcite[82]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} as a cohesive set of functions and data
structures. 

In conclusion, this principle allows for modules with multiple tasks as long as they
cohesively belong together. \textcite[81]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} acknowledges the
slightly inappropriate name of the principle, as many interpreted it that a module should
do just one thing.
