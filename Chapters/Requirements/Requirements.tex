\chapter{Requirements} \label{chap_requirements} 

This Chapter will specify the actual requirements of the software artifacts in Section
\ref{sec_artifact_requirements}. During the Design Cycle of the artifacts we will apply
the 5 basic functional requirements. These requirements are defined by
\textcite[254-261]{mannaert_normalized_2016} as part of a Functional-Construction Software
Transformation. They are used to study the evolvability  of software systems in general
\parencite[251]{mannaert_normalized_2016}. Summarized, these requirements are defined by
\textcite{mannaert_normalized_2016} as followed.

        \hline
        Data & This object represents a piece of data in the system. Data elements are
        used to pass information between processing functions and other objects. In
        \gls{ns}, data elements are typically standardized to ensure consistency across
        the system.\\ \midrule

        Task & This object represents a specific task or action in the system. Tasks can
        be composed of one or more processing functions and can be used to represent
        complex operations within the system.\\ \midrule

        Connector & This object is used to connect different parts of the system.
        Connectors can link processing functions, data elements, and other objects to work
        together seamlessly.\\ \midrule

        Flow & This object represents the flow of control through the system.
        It determines the order in which processing functions are executed and can be used
        to handle error conditions or other exceptional cases.\\ \midrule

        Trigger & A trigger represents an object that reacts to specific events or changes in the system
        by executing predefined actions.\\
