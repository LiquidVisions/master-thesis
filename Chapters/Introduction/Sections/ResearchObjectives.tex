\section{Research Objectives} \label{sec:research_objectives}

In this Design Science research, the focus shifts from a research question toward
research objectives. The following objectives apply to this research.

\subsection*{Objective 1: The expander artifact}
A C\# artifact that consists of a source code expander and some helper classes in order to
generate the second \emph{expanded} artifact. The artifact supports the harvesting and
rejuvenation of custom code snippets on the expanded artifact so that regenerations do not
have a loss of implementations on the expanded artifact. The expander artifact is fully
based on the design principles of Clean Architecture.

Chapter \ref{chap:generator_artifact} fully describes the expander artifact.

\subsection*{Objective 2: The expanded artifact}
A fully working restful API based on ASP.NET and C\# with basic CRUD support. The artifact
has been generated by the \emph{expander} and has been enriched with custom code snippets
in order to comply with the initial requirements. The expanded artifact is fully based on
the design principles of Clean Architecture.

Chapter \ref{chap:generator_artifact} fully describes the expander artifact.
