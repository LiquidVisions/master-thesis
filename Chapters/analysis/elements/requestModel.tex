\subsection{The RequestModel Element} \label{converging_requestmodel_element}

\evaluateElementTable{RequestModel}{tab_convergence_requestmodel}{ \addEvalRow{ Data &
    \fullAlignment & Both elements represent data objects that are part of the ontology or
    data schema of the application, and typically include attributes and relationship
    information. While both elements can contain an aggregated or subset of data
    attributes representing the ontology, the RequestModel element is specifically
    targeting the needs of the input on behalf of a particular Use Case. This is
    illustrated in Code Example \ref{list_deleteentityrequestmodel}, where the available
    data attributes are tailored to the Use Case of deleting an Entity record
    \parencite{koks_deleteentityrequestmodel_2023}.}
