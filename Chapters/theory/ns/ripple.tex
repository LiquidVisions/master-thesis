\subsection{Combinatorial effects versus Ripple effects} \label{subsec_ripple_effect}

\glspl{ce} and \glspl{ripple} are characteristics often used in \gls{ns} Theory. Both are
closely related to the challenges of maintaining evolvable systems but are certainly not
interchangeable. A \gls{ripple} is reffered to indicate the total amount of changes that
are required to adhere to new requirements, while \gls{ce} is the manifestation of
instability and refers to an increasing amount of changes (ripple) as an effect of new
requirements.
