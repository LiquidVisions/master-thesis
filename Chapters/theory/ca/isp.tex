\subsubsection{The Interface Segregation Principle} \label{subsubsec_isp}

The \gls{isp} suggests that software components should have narrow, specific interfaces
rather than broad, general-purpose ones. In addition, the \gls{isp} states that consumer
code should not be allowed to depend on methods it does not use. In other words,
interfaces should be designed to be as small and focused as possible, containing only the
methods relevant to the consumer code using them. This allows for the consumer code to use
only the needed methods without being forced to implement or depend on unnecessary methods
