\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}

\enquote{\emph{Pantha Rhei}} is, according to \emph{Plato}, one of the famous
philosophical statements first described by the Greek philosopher
\emph{Heraclitus}\footnote{\url{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/}}.
Translated as \enquote{everything flows} this statement is an unambiguous commitment to
the ubiquitous dynamics of everything that exists. \enquote{Life is flux}, one of the
constants in life, is change.

In the realms of Software Engineering, the \enquote{laws of software evolution}
\parencite[]{lehman_programs_1980} refers to a series of laws described by
\citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980}. With these Laws, he describes the balance between the
forces driving new developments on the one hand (a change) and the forces that slow down
progress on the other hand. Based on \emph{Heraclitus} philosophical statement, this paper
assumes that software engineering projects will frequently be subjected to change,
probably due to changing market demands or technological progress. 

More than a half of century of software engineering-, and architecture practices show that
the complexity of these software artifacts gradually increases over time. Eventually, this
will render most of the software artifacts obsolete, according to
\citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980} \parencite[]{lehman_programs_1980}.

We also observe that contemporary competitive corporate environments are changing
continuously. The speed at which these changes emerge is also increasing. To stay
competitive it is essential to be able to deal with corporate change and shifting market
demands. \todo{add a citation to the work of Steven de Haes}This is partly driven by
contemporary digital transformations. (IT) Organizations are attempting to cope with this
trend by adopting agility and maturing their agile practices
\parencite[]{2024_SIM_key_issues_and_trends}. Therefore, agility has been proposed as a
measure for contemporary organizations to adapt to new environments and cope with rapid
change \parencite[]{neumann_strategic_1994}.

Over the years, a lot of research is done to mitigate the risks of software artifact
degradation over time. There is also plenty of experience described in various books from
corporate experience. Two of these are part of this research are the Theorems of
Normalized Systems and Uncle Bob's Clean architecture.
