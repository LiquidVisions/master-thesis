\subsection{Theoretical Framework} \label{subsec:ns_desing_theorems}

\gls{ns} consists of a theoretical framework describing a set of design principles. These
principles are the basis for achieving the concepts of stability, evolvability and
modularity. \gls{ns} provides a rigorous and mathematical foundation for these theorems
and they offer guidelines for designing and developing software systems. In the following
sections, we will focus on the principles of \gls{ns}. When applicable, we emphasize some
manifestations in one of the artifacts to demonstrate the level of convergence with
\gls{ca}.
