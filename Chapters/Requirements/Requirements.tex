\chapter{Requirements} \label{chap_requirements} 

This chapter outlines the requirements for this design Science Research study, where we
focus on the stability and evolvability of software Artifacts. Section
\ref{sec_requirements_transformation} begins by discussing software Transformation
Requirements proposed by \textcite{mannaert_normalized_2016}, which serve as a foundation
for assessing the stability \& evolvability of the Artifacts. Next, Section
\ref{sec_artifact_requirements} details the specific requirements of the Artifacts used in
this study. These requirements will help ensure that the Artifacts are suitable for
evaluating the stability \& evolvability of software Artifacts designed based on Clean
Architecture and SOLID Principles.
