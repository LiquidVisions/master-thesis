\addEvalRow{\gls{soc} & \fullAlignment & \gls{lsp} states that objects of a derived class should be
able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the program negatively.
Replacing objects can only be achieved by separating them, aligning the principles
inherritly. A good example is the implementation of the
\citecode{koks_itemplateinteractor_2023} where the template engine Scriban
\parencite{github_scriban_2023} is used to generate code instantiations as a result of the
Expanding the Model \parencite{koks_scribantemplateinteractor_2023}. We could easily
replace the Scriban template engine for an other engine with only impacting the Dependency
Injection Register.}
    
\addEvalRow{\gls{dvt} & \noAlignment & The alignment between \gls{lsp} and \gls{dvt} is weak,
and no manifestations are found in the artifacts.}
    
\addEvalRow{\gls{avt} & \partialAlignment & The \gls{lsp} supports the \gls{avt} principle.
Both principles emphasize the importance of allowing the extensibility of the software
system. By adhering to \gls{lsp}, the architecture allows for class hierarchies that can
be easily extended to accommodate new (versions of) actions, which can contribute to
achieving \gls{avt}. However, adhering to \gls{lsp} alone may not guarantee full adherence
with \gls{avt}. Considder \citecode{koks_icreategateway_2023} in Code Listing
\ref{list_ICreateGatewayExamples}. The artifact contains multiple implementations of this
interface. Each implementation could be considered a different version applied to the
interface.} 
    
\addEvalRow{\gls{sos} & \noAlignment & The \gls{lsp} does not relate to the \gls{sos}
principle. The alignment of both principles is weak, and no manifestations are found in
the artifacts.} }
