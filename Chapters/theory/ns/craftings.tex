\subsection{Craftings}

Craftings are manually inserted code snippets added after the automated instantiation
process to comply with the functional requirements. Craftings are only inserted when
automation instantiation is not possible or desired. These craftings should be preserved
after each expansion. The craftings are preserved by a process called harvesting and
injection \parencite[405-406]{mannaert_normalized_2016}.
