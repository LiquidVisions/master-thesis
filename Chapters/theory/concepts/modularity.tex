\subsection{Modularity} \label{subsec_modularity}

Both CA and NS use a slightly different definitions for the concept of modularity.
\textcite[82]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} describes a module as a piece of code
encapsulated in a source file with a cohesive set of functions and data structures.
According to \textcite[22]{mannaert_normalized_2016}, modularity is a hierarchical or
recursive concept that should exhibits a high degree of cohesion. While both design
approaches agree on the cohesiveness of a module's internal parts, there seems to be a
slight difference in granularity in their definitions.
