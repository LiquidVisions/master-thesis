\section{Problem statement} \label{problem_statement} 

Since the introduction of Normalized Systems Theorems, Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
has been the prevalent programming language used in scientific research settings. It has
been used to describe the evolvability of software architectures based on the stability
concepts of systems theory \parencite[]{mannaert_towards_2012}.

\citeauthor{mannaert_towards_2012} stated in the paper that the design theorems were
formulated as modular structures that are independent of any software language or
development paradigm. The applicability of Normalized Systems Theorems with

Java EE is still a prevalent programming language for enterprise- and IT organizations.
Many software solutions are created and maintained using this programming language.
