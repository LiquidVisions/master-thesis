\section{Converging elements} \label{sec_converging_elements}

In this section, we will apply a systematic cross-referencing approach to assess the level
of convergence between each of the elements of both \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}. Along with a
brief explanation, the level of convergence is denoted as followed:

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l l p{0.57\linewidth}} Strong convergence & \conv & Both
        elements have a high level of similarity or are closely related in terms of their
        purpose, structure, or functionality.\\
        Some convergence & \partconv &  Both elements have some similarities or
        share certain aspects in their purpose, structure, or functionality, but they are
        not identical or directly interchangeable.\\
        No convergence & \noconv &  The elements are not related or have no
        significant similarities in terms of their purpose, structure, or functionality.\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
