\subsection{Component Architecture Requirements}
 
The following requirements are applied to the Component Architecture of both the Generator
Artifact and the Generated Artifact.

        1. & The solution consists of separated C\# projects for the Domain, Application,
        Infrastructure and Presentation layers of the Component. These layers are fully
        described in \fullref{subsec_layers} \\  \hline

        2. & The C\# projects representing the component layers comply the the
        \nameref{appendix_component_naming_convention} laid out in the appendix
        \ref{appendix_component_naming_convention} \\ \hline

        3. & The dependencies between the component layers must point inward toward the
        higher-level components as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig_modulair_components}
        schematically. \\ \hline
