\subsection{Evolvability} \label{sec_on_evolvability}

In section \ref{subsec_on_stability}, it was highlighted that stability in a system is
achieved when it exhibits low sensitivity to minor changes, regardless of the system's
size. On the other hand, evolvability refers to a system's ability to adapt and adjust to
changing requirements continuously. Time is a critical factor here, as systems are often
easier to maintain during the initial stages. Evolvability, however, relates to the
system's ability to evolve and adapt independently of time.
