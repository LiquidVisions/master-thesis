\subsection{The Interactor Element}

\evaluateElementTable{Interactor}{tab_convergence_interactor}{ \addEvalRow{Data &
    \noAlignment &  The Interactor and Data element do not align, although an Interactor
    might use Data elements as input and output during the execution of business logic.}

    \addEvalRow{Task & \fullAlignment &  The Task element in \gls{ns} is very closely related to
        the Interactor element of \gls{ca}, as both encapsulate the execution of business
        logic. Code Listing \ref{list_interactor_task} illustrates an implementation of a
        Task, with a Single execution of a business rule \parencite*{koks_createentityvalidator_2023}. }

    \addEvalRow{Flow & \fullAlignment & The Interactor has a strong alignment with the
        Flow element of \gls{ns} as the both elements can orchestrates the flow of execution for
        a use case, which can involve multiple Tasks in \gls{ns}. This is clearly
        illustrated in Code Listing \ref{list_interactor_flow}, where the Interactor
        handles Validation, mapping and persistance of the Entity. }

    \addEvalRow{Connector & \noAlignment & There is no alignment between the Interactor
    and the Connector Element of \gls{ns}.}
    
    \addEvalRow{Trigger & \noAlignment & There is no alignment between the Interactor
    and the Trigger Element of \gls{ns}.}
