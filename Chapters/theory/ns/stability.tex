\subsection{Stability} \label{subsec_on_stability}

\gls{ns} Theory derives the concept of stability from systems theory. It is considered a
crucial property. \textcite[270]{mannaert_normalized_2016}describe that stable software is
not excessively sensitive to small changes. The number of changes required for new
versions of the system is not dependent on the size of that system. Conversely,
instabilities occur when the total number of changes relies on the size of the system. The
bigger the size of the system, the more changes are required to implement the requirement.
Mannaert et al. \textcite[271]{mannaert_normalized_2016} refer to these instabilities'
