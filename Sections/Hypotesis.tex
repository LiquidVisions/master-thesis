\section{Hypothesis} \label{hypothesis} 

The hypothesis that is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:hypothesis} proposes
that applying both Clean Architecture and Normalized Systems Theorems to a software
architecture leads to a modular software architecture that mitigates combinatorial
effects. Additionally, the hypothesis proposes improved stability and evolvability of
the C\# Software artifact, that is comparable with the result when using Java Software
artifacts \parencites[]{oorts_building_2014, de_bruyn_enabling_2018}.
