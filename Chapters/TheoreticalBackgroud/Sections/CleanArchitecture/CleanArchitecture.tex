\section{Clean architecture: A design approach}\label{sec_ca_theory}

\gls{ca} is a software design approach that emphasizes the organization of code
into independent, modular layers with distinct responsibilities. This approach aims to
create more flexible, maintainable, and testable software systems by enforcing the
separation of concerns and minimizing dependencies between components. The goal of clean
architecture is to provide a solid foundation for software development, allowing
developers to build applications that can adapt to changing requirements, scale
effectively, and remain resilient against the introduction of bugs
