\section{Introduction to Normalized Systems} \label{sec_inro_ns}

The \gls{ns} Theory is a scientific approach to creating software systems based on the
laws for software evolvability. Effectively, it prevents the accumulation of required
changes to implement new requirements \parencite[]{mannaert_normalized_2009}. 

\textcite[]{mannaert_normalized_2009} have formulated the Theories of \gls{ns} as a set of
principles accompanied by structures (elements) that will lead to a highly decouples and
modular software system. The result is a software architecture designed to cope with
future changes.
