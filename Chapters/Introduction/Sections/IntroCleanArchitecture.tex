\section{Introduction to Clean Architecture} \label{sec_into_ca}

\gls{ca} is the accumulation of more than half a century of coding, designing, and
architecting software systems by \citeauthor*[]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018}. He published
his experience in his book \citetitle*[]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} in
\citeyear[]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018}. In this book, he states that creating a software
artifact requires less skill and knowledge. However, creating stable and evolvable
software artifacts is a skill that requires a lot of knowledge, skill, dedication, and
time.

The book aims for a software architecture that minimizes the human resources required to
build and maintain the information system. Like \gls{ns}, it has a
prescribed design of software classes that will lead to a modular architecture with low
coupling and high cohesion \parencite{robert_c_martin_clean_2018}.
