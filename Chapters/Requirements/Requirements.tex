\chapter{Requirements} \label{chap_requirements} 

Since we are researching the convergence level between \gls{ca} with \gls{ns} in a
real-life artifacts, we need a design cycle that complies to the evolvability requirements
of \gls{ns} 

As such, the design and architecture requirements are intentionally and
entirely based on the principles and design approach of \gls{ca}. A full description of
this requirement can be found in section \ref{sec_artifact_requirements}. In order to
analyze the level of convergence, the artifacts need to comply with the evolvability
requirements of the theory of \gls{ns}, described in section
\ref{sec_research_requirements} of this chapter.
