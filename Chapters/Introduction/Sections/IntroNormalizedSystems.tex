\section{Introduction to Normalized Systems} \label{sec_inro_ns}

The \gls{ns} Theory is a scientific approach to creating software systems based on the
laws for software evolvability. \gls{ns} has contributed to a documented track record of
achieving software stability in a scientific environment. Effectively, it prevents the
accumulation of required changes required on the implementation of new requirements
\parencite[]{mannaert_normalized_2009}. 

\citeauthor[]{mannaert_normalized_2009} have formulated the Theories of \gls{ns} as rigid
structures (elements) that lead to a modular architecture with low coupling and high
cohesion. The resulting software architecture will be designed to cope with future
changes.
