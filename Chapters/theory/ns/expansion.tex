\subsection{Expansion} \label{subsec_expansion}

Creating and maintaining a stable and evolvable system is, according to
\textcite[403]{mannaert_normalized_2016}, a particularly challenging, repetitive, and
meticulous engineering job. Developers must have a sound knowledge of NS while
implementing new requirements in an always consistent manner.
\textcite[403]{mannaert_normalized_2016} propose to automate the instantiation process of
software structures by using code generation for recurring tasks. This process is referred
to expansion.
