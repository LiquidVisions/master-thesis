\section{Research questions} \label{research_questions}
Considering the hypothesis described in \ref{conceptualframework} the following research
is determined:

\begin{center}
    \enquote*{\textit{What is the applicability of Normalized Systems Theorems
    on restful APIs designed based on the Clean Architecture principles and build with
    C\#/.NET}}
\end{center}

The following sub-questions can be formulated that support the research on the main
research question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the literature stating about evolvable software systems.
    \item What is the literature stating about combinatorial effects on software changes in software systems.
    \item What is the literature stating on how one can measure combinatorial effects of a change on a software system.
    \item Which principles of Clean Architecture contribute to a reduction of
    combinatorial effects, in a way that they complement the theorems of normalized
    systems.
\end{itemize}
