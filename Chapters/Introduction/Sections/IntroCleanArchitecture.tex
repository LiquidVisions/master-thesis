\section{Introducing Clean Architecture}

Clean Architecture is the accumulation of more than half a century of coding, designing,
and architecting software systems by \citeauthor*[]{martin_clean_2018}. He published his
experience in his book \citetitle*[]{martin_clean_2018} in \citeyear[]{martin_clean_2018}.
In this book, he states that creating a software artifact does not require that much skill
and knowledge. However, creating stable and evolvable software artifacts is a skill that
requires a lot of knowledge, skill, dedication, and time.

The book's goal is to have a software architecture that minimizes the human resources
required to build and maintain the information system. Just like Normalized Systems, it
has a prescribed design of software classes that will lead to a modular architecture with
low coupling and high cohesion \parencite{martin_clean_2018}.
