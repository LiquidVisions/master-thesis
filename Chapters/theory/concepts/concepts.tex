\section{Generic Concepts} \label{section_key_concepts}

In the upcoming sections, we will explore the fundamental ideas of modularity, cohesion,
and coupling. These are all concepts that both \gls{ca} and \gls{ns} incorporate.
Moreover, these concepts are essential to understanding the software artifacts'
implementation and analysis.
