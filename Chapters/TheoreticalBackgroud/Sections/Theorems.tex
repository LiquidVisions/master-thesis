\subsection{The Design Theorems} \label{subsec:ns_desing_theorems}

\gls{ns} Theorems is a theoretical framework of principles that aims to enhance the
stability of a software artifact. \gls{ns} provides a rigorous mathematical foundation
that offers guidelines for designing and developing software systems. The principles of NS
have gained significant attention in both academic and industrial circles due to their
potential to increase the evolvability and stability of software artifacts while reducing
maintenance costs. The theorems have been scientifically established and proven. In the
following sections, we will focus on the theorems of \gls{ns}. When applicable, we
emphasize some manifestations in one of the artifacts to demonstrate the level of
convergence of \gls{ca}.
