\subsection{The Entity Element}

\evaluateElementTable{Entity}{tab_convergence_entity}{
    \addEvalRow{Data & \partialAlignment & Both elements represent data objects that are part of the
        ontology or data schema of the application, and typically include attributes and
        relationship information. While both can contain a full set of attributes and
        relationships, the Data entity of \gls{ns} may also include a specific set of
        information that is required for a single task or use case.}

    \addEvalRow{Task & \noAlignment & The Entity is not convergent with the Task
        element of \gls{ns}. However, the Tasks element might operate on entities to
        perform business logic.}

    \addEvalRow{Flow & \noAlignment & The Entity and Flow are not convergent, as the Flow element
        represents the control between Tasks in \gls{ns}, while the Entity in \gls{ca}
        represents domain objects.}

    \addEvalRow{Connector & \noAlignment & The Entity element and Connector element are not
        convergent, as the Connector element in \gls{ns} is involved in between components,
        while the Entity in \gls{ca} represents domain objects.}
    
    \addEvalRow{Trigger & \noAlignment & The Entity element and Trigger element are not convergent,
        as the Trigger element in \gls{ns} is about event-based execution of Tasks, while
        the Entity in \gls{ca} represents domain objects.}
