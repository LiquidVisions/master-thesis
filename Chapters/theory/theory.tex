\chapter{Theoretical background} \label{chap_theoreticalbackground} 

This thesis aims to investigate whether the \gls{ca} approach converges or aligns with the goals
of NS. Therefore, it is essential to understand the key concepts and principles, design
elements, and characteristics of both software design approaches. 

This chapter starts with the concepts that apply to both \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}. We then
will briefly refer to the essential concepts of \gls{ns}, briefly discussing the design
theorems and elements. Lastly, we will explore the fundamental principles that
underlie \gls{ca} and its proposed architectural designs.
