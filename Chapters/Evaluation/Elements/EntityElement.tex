\subsection{Converging the Entity element} \label{converging_entity_element}

The following \ns elements are directly convergent with the \emph{Entity} element of
\ca. The \emph{Task}, \emph{Flow}, \emph{Connector} and \emph{Trigger} elements are
in no way convergent as they differ in the perspective of structure, intent, purpose and
functionality.
