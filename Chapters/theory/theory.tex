\chapter{Theoretical background} \label{chap_theoreticalbackground} 

This thesis aims to study the convergence of \gls{ca} with \gls{ns}. Therefore, it is
essential to understand the key concepts and principles, design elements, and
characteristics of both software design approaches. This chapter starts with concepts that
apply to both \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}, followed by a reference to the essential concepts,
principles, and design elements of \gls{ns}. We will conclude with the concepts,
principles, and elements of \gls{ca}.
