\section{An Analysis of Priniples} \label{sec_converging_principles}

In this section, we will apply a systematic cross-referencing approach of each of the
principles of \gls{ca} with \gls{ns}. By cross-referencing these principles, we aim to
uncover the degree of convergence between \gls{ca} and \gls{ns} from a theoretical
perspective, supported by examples from the artifacts. Along this explanation, the level
of convergence is denoted as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l l p{0.57\linewidth}} 
        
    Strong convergence & \fullConvergence & This indicates that the principles of \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}
    are highly converged. Both have a similar impact on the design and implementation of the
    artifact. \\
        
    Supports convergence & \npartialConvergence & The \gls{ca} principle supports in implementing the
    \gls{ns} principle through specific design choices. However, applying the \gls{ca}
    principle does not inherently ensure adherence to the corresponding \gls{ns}
    principle. \\
        
    No or weak convergence & \noConvergence & The principles have no significant similarities
    in terms of their purpose, goals, or architectural supports \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
