\subsection{The Entity Element}

    Both elements represent data objects that are part of the ontology or data schema of
    the application, and typically include attributes and relationship information. While
    both can contain a full set of attributes and relationships, the Data Element of
    \gls{ns} may also be tailored to serve a specific set of information that is required
    for a single task or use case. In \gls{ca} these type of Data Elements are specified
    explicitly as ViewModels, RequestModels or ResponseModels. Code Listing
    \ref{list_entity} illustrates an example of an Entity in a way that is very similar to
    the Data Element from \gls{ns} \parencite{koks_entity_2023}}
