\subsection{Screaming Architecture}

\Citeauthor{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} adopts this concept of Screaming Architecture from
\textcite{jacobson_object-oriented_1992}, who points out that software Architecture are
structures that supports Use Cases of a software system.
\textcite[195]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} builds on the idea that Software architectures
should emphasize the system's intent, theme, and purpose rather than being dictated by
frameworks, technology, and delivery mechanisms.
