\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{subsec_anticipated_changes}

Conversely, instabilities occur when the total number of changes relies
on the size of the system. The bigger the size of the system, the more changes are
required to implement the requirement.\textcite[271]{mannaert_normalized_2016} refer to
these instabilities as Combinatorial Effects.
