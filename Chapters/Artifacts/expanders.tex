\section{Expanders}
\todo{check this}
The requirement for an expander is to have an implementation of the
\citecode{koks_iexpanderinteractor_2023} interface, as displayed in Figure
\ref{fig_expander_design}. Although it is not mandatory, it is recommended to use the
abstract \citecode{koks_abstractexpander_2023} class, which provides a full Expander
experience.
