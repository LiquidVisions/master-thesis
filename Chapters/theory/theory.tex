\chapter{Exploring the Concepts of Clean Architecture and Normalized Systems} \label{chap_theoreticalbackground} 

This research aims to study the convergence of \gls{ca} with \gls{ns}. This chapter will
describe the key concepts and principles, design elements, and characteristics of both
software design approaches that affect the research conclusion. This chapter starts with
concepts that apply to both \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}, followed by a reference to the
essential concepts, principles, and design elements of \gls{ns}, followed by the concepts,
principles, and elements of \gls{ca}. We will briefly discuss each subject with little
detail on the theory, as most concepts have been thoroughly documented in the literature.
