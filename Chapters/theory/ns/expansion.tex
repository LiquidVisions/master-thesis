\subsection{Expansion and code generation} \label{subsec_expansion}

Creating and maintaining a stable and evolvable system is, according to
\textcite[403]{mannaert_normalized_2016}, a particularly challenging, repetitive, and
meticulous engineering job. Developers must have a sound knowledge of NS while
implementing new requirements in an always consistent manner.
\textcite[403]{mannaert_normalized_2016} propose to automate the instantiation process of
software structures by using code generation for recurring tasks

\subsection{Harvesting and Injection}
Expansion and code generation should embrace manually added craftings on parts of the
system where automation is not possible or desirable. These craftings are preserved after
each expansion by a method that is called harvesting and injection
