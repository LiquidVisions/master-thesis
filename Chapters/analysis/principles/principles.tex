\section{An Analysis of Priniples} \label{sec_converging_principles}

In this section, we will apply a systematic cross-referencing approach to assess the level
of alignment between each of the principles of \gls{ca} with \gls{ns}. Along with a brief
explanation, the level of alignment is denoted as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l l p{0.57\linewidth}} 
        
    Strong alignment & \fullAlignment & This indicates that the principles of \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}
    are highly aligned. Both have a similar impact on the design and implementation of the
    artifact. \\
        
    Supports alignment & \partialAlignment & The \gls{ca} principle supports in implementing the
    \gls{ns} principle through specific design choices. However, applying the \gls{ca}
    principle does not inherently ensure adherence to the corresponding \gls{ns}
    principle. \\
        
    No or weak alignment & \noAlignment & The principles are not aligned or have no significant
    similarities in terms of their purpose, goals, or architectural supports \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
