\section{Introducing Normalized Systems Theorems}

The Normalized Systems theorems are a scientific approach to creating software systems
based on the laws for software evolvability. These theorems have resulted in a documented
track record of achieving software stability, in a scientific environment. Effectively, it
prevents the accumulation of combinatorial effects on anticipated change drivers. This
prevents the positive feedback loop and prevents the degradation of the software artifact.
Preventing positive feedback loops has a positive effect on the evolvability of software
artifacts.\parencite[]{mannaert_normalized_2009}. 

\citeauthor[]{mannaert_normalized_2009} have formulated the theorem of Normalized Systems
as prescriptive structures (elements) that lead to a modular architecture with low
coupling and high cohesion. The resulting software architecture will be designed to cope
with future change \parencites[]{mannaert_normalized_2009}.
