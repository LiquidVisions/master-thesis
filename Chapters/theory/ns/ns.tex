\section{Normalized Systems Theory} \label{sec_ns_theory}

The Theory of \gls{ns} revolves around modular structures in information systems and their
behavior when modified over time. \gls{ns} uses scientific insights from System Theory and
Statistical Entropy from Thermodynamics. \gls{ns} has a background in software
engineering. However, the underlying Theory of \gls{ns} can be applied to various other
domains, such as Enterprise Engineering \parencite{huysmans_towards_2013}, Business
Process Modeling \parencite{van_nuel_towards_2011}, and the application in TCP-IP based
firewall rule base \parencite{haerens_evolvability_2021}. This emphasizes the impact that
\gls{ns} Theory has. In the following sections, we will highlight the concepts of
\gls{ns} Theory that has impacted this study.
