\subsection{Pantha Rhei}

Whereas the internal workings of the expander artifact are inspired by the Prime Radiant
applications of NSX \footnote{\url{https://normalizedsystems.org/prime-radiant/}}, the
name of the artifact directly derives from \emph{Heraclitus's} most famous quote
\emph{Pantha Rhei}. The artifact supports the continuous flow of new requirements whilst
maintaining the required level of stability and evolvability of the generated artifacts.

It is rather simple to install the expander artifact by following the instruction in the
appendix \ref{appendix:installation_instructions} \nameref{appendix:installation_instructions}
