\section{Designing and Creating the generator artifact} \label{sec_generator_artifact}

In the previous chapters, we discussed the importance of software stability and
evolvability in order to cope with the continuously changing business and technological
requirements. Although considered from a much broader perspective, the Greek philosopher
\emph{Heraclitus} described this state of constant \emph{flux} with his famous statement
\emph{Pantha Rhei}. His statement was the main inspiration for the name of the generator
artifact.

The following sections discuss the design, implementations and functionality of the Pantha
Rhei, the generator artifact. The artifact is created in fulfillment of this research.
Whereas the name of the artifact was inspired by Heraclitus, the functional idea behind
the artifact was inspired by the theory behind \gls{ns} and by the Prime Radiant
application of the company NSX
\footnote{\url{https://normalizedsystems.org/prime-radiant/}}. The concept of code
generation in order to achieve stable and evolvable software is one of the important aspects
of \gls{ns}.

For the interested readers of this thesis, it is rather simple to install the Pantha Rhei
application by following the instruction in the appendix
\fullref{appendix_installation_instructions}.
