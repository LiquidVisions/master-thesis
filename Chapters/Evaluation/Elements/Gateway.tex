\subsection{The Gateway Element}

\evaluateElementTable{Gateway}{tab_convergence_gateway}{
    \addEvalRow{ Data & \noconv &  The Gateway and Data element are not convergent. Nevertheless,
        the Gateway element might interact with data entities when providing access to
        external resources or systems.}

    \addEvalRow{Task & \noconv &  The Gateway and Task element are not convergent. Nevertheless,
        the Task elements might use gateways when interacting with external resources or systems
        during the execution of business logic.}

    \addEvalRow{Flow & \noconv & The Gateway and Flow element are not directly related, as the Flow
        element represents the orchestration between Tasks in \gls{ns}, whilst the Gateway
        element in \gls{ca} provide access to external resources or systems.}

    \addEvalRow{Connector & \conv & The Gateway and Connector element have a strong convergence, as both
        are involved in communication between components and provide interfaces for
        accessing external resources or systems.}
    
    \addEvalRow{Trigger & \noconv & The Gateway and Trigger element are not convergent, as the
        Trigger in \gls{ns} is about event-based execution of Tasks, whilst the Gateway in
        \gls{ca} provide access to external resources or systems.}
