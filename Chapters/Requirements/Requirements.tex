\chapter{Requirements} \label{chap_requirements} 

This Chapter will specify the actual requirements of the software artifacts in Section
\ref{sec_artifact_requirements}. We are studying the stability and evolvability by
investigating potential Combinatorial Effects in \gls{ca} artifacts. During the
implementation, we will apply parts of the Functional-Construction Software Transformation
from \textcite[251]{mannaert_normalized_2016} by using the following five proposed
Functional Requirements Specifications. \textcite[254-261]{mannaert_normalized_2016} have
defnined them as followed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item An information system needs to be able to represent instances of
    data entities. A data entity consists of several data fields. Such a field may be a basic
    data field representing a value of a reference to another data entity.
    
    \item An information system needs to be able to execute processing actions on
    instances of data entities. A processing action consists of several consecutive processing
    tasks. Such a task may be a basic task, i.e., a unit of processing that can change
    independently, or an invocation of another processing action.
    
    \item An information system needs to be able to input or output values
    of instances of data entities through connectors.
    
    \item An existing information system representing a set of data entities, needs
    to be able to represent: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a new version of a data entity that corresponds to including an additional
        data field
        \item an additional data entity 
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item An existing information system providing a set of processing
    actions, needs to be able to provide:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a new version of a processing task, whose use may be mandatory
        \item a new version of a processing action, whose use may be mandatory
        \item an additional processing task
        \item an additional processing action
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}
