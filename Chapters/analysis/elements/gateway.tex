\subsection{The Gateway Element}

\evaluateElementTable{Gateway}{tab_convergence_gateway}{ \addEvalRow{ Data & \noAlignment
    &  There is no alignment between the Gateway element of \gls{ca} and the Data element
    of \gls{ns} and no manifestations are found in the Artifact.}

    \addEvalRow{Task & \noAlignment &  There is no alignment between the Gateway element
    of \gls{ca} and the Task element of \gls{ns} and no manifestations are found in the
    Artifact}

    \addEvalRow{Flow & \noAlignment & There is no alignment between the Gateway element of
    \gls{ca} and the Flow element of \gls{ns} and no manifestations are found in the
    Artifact}

    \addEvalRow{Connector & \fullAlignment & The Gateway element of \gls{ca} has a strong
    alignment with the Connector element of \gls{ns}, as both are involved in
    communication between components and provide interfaces for accessing external
    resources or systems. Code Listing \ref{list_ICreateGatewayExamples} is an example of
    two different type of Gateways. The \citecode{koks_harvestrepository_2023} interacts
    with the File System of the operating system, while
    \citecode{koks_genericrepository_2023} interacts with a SQL Database. }
    
    \addEvalRow{Trigger & \noAlignment & There is no alignment between the Gateway element
    of \gls{ca} and the Trigger element of \gls{ns} and no manifestations are found in the
    Artifact} }
