\section{The Artifact name and use} \label{sec_artifact_name}

The name of the Expander Framework, Pantha Rhei, was inspired by the Greek philosopher
\emph{Heraclitus}, who famously stated that \enquote{life is flux}. The name reflects the
artifact's ability to cope with constant change in a stable and evolvable manner. The name
is also reflected in the use of the \enquote{flux} command in the \gls{cli}, which allows
users to interact with the application.

To install Pantha Rhei, interested readers can follow the instructions provided in the
appendix \fullref{appendix_installation_instructions}.
