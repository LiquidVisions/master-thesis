\subsection{The Design principles} \label{subsec_design_principles}

\textcite[78]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} argues that software can quickly become a
well-intended mess of bricks and building blocks without a rigorous set of design
principles. So, from the early 1980s, he began to assemble a set of software design
principles as guidelines to create software structures that tolerate change and are easy
to understand. The principles are intended to promote modular and component-level software
structure \parencite[79]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018}. In 2004 the arrangement of the
principles was definitively arranged to form the acronym SOLID. 

The upcoming sections will provide an overview of each of the SOLID principles.
