\subsection{Modularity}

Both CA and NS use a slightly different definitions for the concept of modularity.
\textcite[82]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} describes a module as a piece of code
encapsulated in a source file with a cohesive set of functions and data structures.
According to \textcite[22]{mannaert_normalized_2016}, a module is part of a system that
exhibits high cohesion and operates independently of other parts. 

While both design approaches agree on the cohesiveness of a module's internal parts, there
seems to be a slight difference in granularity in their definitions.
