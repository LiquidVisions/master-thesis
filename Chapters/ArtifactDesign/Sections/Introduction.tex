    \item A model that describes an information system that can Create, Read, Update and
    Delete context-independent models
    \item An application confined in a command-line interface that...
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item loads and validates the model 
        \item loads and validates pluggable expanders
        \item has support for expanding models to software artifacts
        \item has support for harvesting and rejuvenation of custom code
    \end{enumerate}
    \item has an expander that generates a restful service based on the model described
    in point of this list. The expander generates the services based on the principles
    and architecture rules of Clean Architecture.
