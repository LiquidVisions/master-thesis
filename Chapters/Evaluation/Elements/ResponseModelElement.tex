\subsection{Converging the ResponseModel element} \label{converging_responsemodel_element}

The following \gls{ns} elements are convergent with the ResponseModel element of
\gls{ca}. The Task, Flow, Connector and Trigger elements are in no way convergent as they
differ in the perspective of structure, intent, purpose and functionality.

        Data & \someConvergence & The ResponseModel and \gls{ns} Data element convergent
        to a limited degree. Both are involved in defining the structure of data used in
        the system. This includes required information about attributes and relationships.
        The ResponseModel represents output data for a specific interactor and will most
        likely contain only the information that is needed in response for that specific
        use case. \\
