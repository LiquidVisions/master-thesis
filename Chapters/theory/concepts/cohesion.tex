\subsection{High Cohesion} \label{subsubsec_on_cohesion}

\textcite[22]{mannaert_normalized_2016} consider cohesion as modules that exist out of
connected or interrelated parts of a hierarchical structure. On the other hand,
\textcite[118]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} discusses cohesion in the context of
components. He attributes the three component cohesion principles as crucial to group
classes or functions into cohesive components. Cohesion is a complex and dynamic process,
as the level of cohesiveness might evolve as requirements change over time. The component
cohesion principles are further described in \textit{Appendix
\ref{appendix_cohesion_principles} \nameref{appendix_cohesion_principles}}, and the
beneficiary impact of applying cohesion on this researchâ€™s artifacts.
