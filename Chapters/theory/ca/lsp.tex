\subsubsection{The Liskov Substitution Principle} \label{subsubsec_lsp}

The\gls{lsp} is named after Barbara Liskov, who first introduced the principle in a paper
she co-authored in 1987. Barbara Liskov wrote the following statement to define subtypes
(Robert C. Martin, 2018, p. 95). 

\textit{If for each object o1 of type S, there is an object o2 of
type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged
when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.1.} Or in simpler terms: To build
Software from interchangeable parts, those parts must adhere to a contract that allows
those parts to be substituted for an other (Robert C. Martin, 2018, p. 80)
