\subsection{Software Architecture Requirements} \label{software_requirements}

Figure \ref{fig_design} illustrates the generic Software Architecture of the Artifacts.
Each instantiated element adheres to the Element Naming Convention outlined in Appendix
\ref{appendix_element_naming_convention}. In addition, the following tables detail the
requirements specific to each element.

    the ViewModel, constructing the HTTP Response message, or combining both elements as

    specific implementations of the IMapper interface.}

\subsubsection*{Design Principles compliancy}
Each architectural pattern adheres to at least one of the SOLID principles to ensure that
none of the implementations violate these principles.
