\subsection{The Design Elements} \label{subsec_design_elements}

\textcite{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} proposes the following elements to achieve
the goal of \enquote{Clean Architecture}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ p{0.17\linewidth} p{0.74\linewidth}}
        \hline
        \textbf{Element} & \textbf{Description} \\ 
        \hline
        Entity & Entities are the core business objects, representing the domain's
        fundamental data.\\ \midrule

        Interactor & Interactors encapsulate business logic and represent specific actions
        that the system can perform. \\ \midrule

        RequestModel & RequestModels are used to represent the input data required by a specific
        interactor.\\ \midrule

        ViewModel & ViewModels are responsible for managing the data and behaviour of the
        user interface. \\ \midrule

        Controller & Controllers are responsible for handling requests from the user
        interface and routing them to the appropriate Interactor.\\ \midrule

        Presenter & Presenters are responsible for formatting and the data for the user
        interface.\\ \midrule

        Gateway & A Gateway provides an abstraction layer between the application and its
        external dependencies, such as databases, web services, or other external
        systems.\\ \midrule

        Boundary & Boundaries are used to separate the the different layers of the component.\\
