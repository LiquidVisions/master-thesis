\subsection{Expansion and code generation} \label{subsec_expansion}

Creating and maintaining a stable and evolvable system is a particularly challenging and
meticulous engineering job. Developers are required to have a sound knowledge of \ns,
whilst implementing new requirements in an always consistent manner. Given the recurring
structures, processing new requirements is a very precise, strict and meticulous job.
\parencite[403]{mannaert_normalized_2016} Manual labor could be error-prone given modern
time-to-market requirements. 

Therefore, it seems logical to automate the instantiation process of software structures
and use code generation for recurring tasks \parencite[403]{mannaert_normalized_2016}.
This is where the concepts of code generation and expansion come into place. This does not
only refer to the automatic process of adapting and maintaining software to new
requirements, architectural enablers and technological alterations. It also embraces
manually added craftings to the software, the so-called plugin code. These craftings are
preserved after each expansion by a method that is called harvesting and rejuvenation
\parencite[405-406]{mannaert_normalized_2016}.
