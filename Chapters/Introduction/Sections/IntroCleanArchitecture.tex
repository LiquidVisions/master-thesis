\section{Introducing Clean Architecture}

Clean Architecture is the accumulation of more than half a century of coding, designing,
and architecting software systems by Martin, Robert C. He published experience in his book
\citetitle*[]{martin_clean_2018} in \citeyear[]{martin_clean_2018}. He states that it does
not take much skill and knowledge to create a program like an information system.
Designing software to be stable and evolvable so it can endure the tests of time.

The book's goal is to have a software architecture that minimizes the human resources
required to build and maintain the information system. Just like Normalized Systems, it
has a prescribed design of software classes that will lead to a modular architecture with
low coupling and high cohesion \parencite{martin_clean_2018}.
