\subsection{Converging the Boundary element}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l | c | p{0.70\linewidth}}
        \toprule
        Data & \noconv &  The Boundary and Data elements are not convergent, as the
        Boundary element is focused on separating concerns between components, while the
        Data element of \gls{ns} represents a domain object.\\ \midrule

        Task & \noconv &  The Boundary and Flow Task element are not convergent, However,
        the Boundary element can be used in a Task element to ensure a clear separation
        of concerns between different modules.\\ \midrule
        
        Flow & \partconv & The Boundary and Flow element are not convergent, However, the
        Boundary element can be used in a Flow element to ensure a clear separation of
        concerns between different modules.\\ \midrule
        
        Connector & \conv & The Boundary and Connector elements have a strong convergence,
        as both are involved in communication between components and help ensure loose
        coupling between these components.\\ \midrule
        
        Trigger & \noconv & The Boundary and Trigger element are not convergent, as the
        Trigger in \gls{ns} is about event-based execution of Tasks, whilst the Boundary in
        \gls{ca} ensures the separation of concerns between components of the system.\\ \bottomrule
