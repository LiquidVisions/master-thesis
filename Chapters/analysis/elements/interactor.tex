\subsection{The Interactor Element}

\evaluateElementTable{Interactor}{tab_convergence_interactor}{
    \addEvalRow{Data & \noAlignment &  The Interactor and Data elements are not convergent. However,
        Interactors might use Data elements as input and output during the execution of
        business logic.}

    \addEvalRow{Task & \fullAlignment &  The Task element in \gls{ns} is very closely related to
        the Interactor element of \gls{ca}, as both encapsulate the execution of business
        logic.}

    \addEvalRow{Flow & \partialAlignment & The Interactor and Flow elements are partly convergent, as the
        Interactor orchestrates the flow of execution for a use case, which can involve
        multiple Tasks in \gls{ns}.}

    \addEvalRow{Connector & \noAlignment & The Interactor and Connector elements are not convergent.
        However, the Interactor might rely on connectors to communicate with other
        components in the system.}
    
    \addEvalRow{Trigger & \noAlignment & The Interactor and Trigger elements are not convergent.
        However, the Interactors can be triggered by events or external requests, similar to
        \gls{ns} Trigger elements.}
