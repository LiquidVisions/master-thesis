\subsection{Converging the Interactor element}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l | c | p{0.71\linewidth}}
        \toprule
        Data & \noconv &  The Interactor and Data elements are not convergent. However,
        Interactors might use Data elements as input and output during the execution of
        business logic.\\ \midrule

        Task & \conv &  The Task element in \gls{ns} is very closely related to
        the Interactor element of \gls{ca}, as both encapsulate the execution of business
        logic.\\ \midrule
        
        Flow & \partconv & The Interactor and Flow elements are partly convergent, as the
        Interactor orchestrates the flow of execution for a use case, which can involve
        multiple Tasks in \gls{ns}.\\ \midrule
        
        Connector & \noconv & The Interactor and Connector elements are not convergent.
        However, the Interactor might rely on connectors to communicate with other
        components in the system.\\ \midrule
        
        Trigger & \noconv & The Interactor and Trigger elements are not convergent.
        However, the Interactors can be triggered by events or external requests, similar to
        \gls{ns} Trigger elements. \\ \bottomrule
