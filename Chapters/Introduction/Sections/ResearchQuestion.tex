\section{Research questions} \label{research_questions}
The Hypothesis described in \ref{hypothesis} and \ref{conceptualframework} leads us to the
following research question:

\begin{center}
    \enquote*{\textit{To what extent converges the evolvability of a C\# artifact built
    based on the Clean Architecture principles towards a similar artifact that is based on
    Normalized Systems Theorems?}}
\end{center}

The following sub-questions can be formulated that support the research on the main
research question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does Clean Architecture contribute to Software Evolvability?
    \item To what extent Is Normalized Systems applicable to a C\# artifact?   
\end{itemize}
