\section{Problem statement} \label{problem_statement} 

Since the introduction of Normalized Systems Theorems, Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
was used as a programming language in scientific research settings to describe the
evolvability of software architectures based on the stability concepts of systems theory
\parencite[]{mannaert_towards_2012}. \citeauthor{mannaert_towards_2012} stated in the
paper that the design theorems were formulated as modular structures that are independent
of any software language or development paradigm.

Java EE is still a prevalent programming language for enterprise- and IT organizations.
Many software solutions are created and maintained using this programming language.
