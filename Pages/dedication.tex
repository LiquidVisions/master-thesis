\par\vspace*{.35\textheight}{\centering In loving dedication to my cherished family
members. To my parents, who are courageously battling a devastating illness and have been
admitted to a care home during the final stages of my research, my thoughts are always with
you. I am eternally grateful to my brother and sister for their understanding and patience
as I poured my heart into this pursuit. And to the brightest star in my life, my dear
daughter Emma. To all of you, thank you for your unwavering love, support, and belief in
me. I love you all!\par}
