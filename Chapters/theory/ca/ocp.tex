\subsubsection{The Open-Closed Principle} \label{subsubsec_ocp}

\textcite{meyer_object-oriented_1988} first mentioned the \gls{ocp} and formulated the
following definition: \textit{A module should be open for extension but closed for
modification.} The software architecture should be designed such that the behavior of a
module can be extended without modifying existing source code. The \gls{ocp} promotes the
use of abstraction and polymorphism to achieve this goal. The \gls{ocp} is one of the
driving forces behind the software architecture of systems making it relatively easy to
apply new requirements. \parencite[94]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018}.
