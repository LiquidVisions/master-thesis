\section{The Convergence of Priniples} \label{sec_converging_principles}

In this section, we will apply a systematic cross-referencing approach to assess the level
of convergence between each of the principles of \gls{ca} with \gls{ns}. Along with
a brief explanation, the level of convergence is denoted as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l l p{0.57\linewidth}} Fully converges & \conv & This indicates that
    the principles of \gls{ca} and \gls{ns} are highly aligned. Both have a similar impact
    on the design and implementation of the artifact. \\
        
        Supports convergence & \partconv & The \gls{ca} principle supports in implementing
        the \gls{ns} principle through specific design choices. However, applying the
        \gls{ca} principle does not inherently ensure adherence to the corresponding
        \gls{ns} principle. \\
        
        No convergence & \noconv & There appears to be a discrepancy between the \gls{ca}
        principle and its corresponding \gls{ns} principle. \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
