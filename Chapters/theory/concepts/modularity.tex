\subsection{Modularity} \label{subsec_modularity}

The original material of \textcite[82]{robert_c_martin_clean_2018} describes a module as a
piece of code encapsulated in a source file with a cohesive set of functions and data
structures. According to \textcite[22]{mannaert_normalized_2016}, modularity is a
hierarchical or recursive concept that should exhibit high cohesion. While both design
approaches agree on the cohesiveness of a module's internal parts, there is a slight
difference in granularity in their definitions.
