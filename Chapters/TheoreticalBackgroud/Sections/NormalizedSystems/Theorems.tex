\subsection{The Theoretical Framework} \label{subsec:ns_desing_theorems}

\gls{ns} consists of a theoretical framework describing a set of design principles. These
principles are the basis for achieving the concepts of stability, evolvability and
modularity. \gls{ns} provides a rigorous and mathematical foundation for these theorems
and they offer guidelines for designing and developing software systems. In the following
sections, we will focus on the principles of \gls{ns} very briefly as they have been
extensively described in various scientific papers.

We know from Chapter \ref{sec:artifact_requirements} that the design artifacts, as a part
of this research, are implemented based on the \gls{ca} principles. Therefore, contrary to
Chapter \ref{sec:ca_theory}, there will be no references to the manifestations of the NS
design theorems in the design.
