\section{Normalized Systems Theory} \label{sec_ns_theory}

\gls{ns} is a computer science approach that aims to create stable and evolvable systems.
\gls{ns} utilizes scientific insights from System Theory and Entropy from Statistical
Thermodynamics. This Thesis acknowledges the software engineering background of \gls{ns},
as it consistently refers to software Artifacts and Information Systems. However, the
underlying Theory of \gls{ns} can be applied to various other domains, such as Enterprise
Engineering \parencite{huysmans_towards_2013}, Business Process Modeling
\parencite{van_nuel_towards_2011}, and the application in TCP-IP based firewall rule base
\parencite{haerens_evolvability_2021}, emphasizing the impact of \gls{ns} Theory. In the
following sections, we will highlight the concepts of \gls{ns} Theory that has impacted
this study.
