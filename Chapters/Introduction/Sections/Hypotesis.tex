\section{Hypothesised outcome} \label{hypothesis} 

The proposed hypothesis is that the \gls{ca} approach can be applied in conjunction with
the \gls{ns} theorems. The design principles of \gls{ca} converge with the theorems of
\gls{ns}. Consequently, the artifact that is part of this design research will lead to a
highly modular, stable, and evolvable C\# artifact that does not contradict Normalized
Systems theorems.

Both architectural approaches formulate modular structures independent of any programming
technology \parencite{mannaert_normalized_2009,robert_c_martin_clean_2018}. As such, the
C\# artifact produced as part of this research has similar trademarks of modularity,
evolvability, and stability compared to case studies where Java SE has been used
\parencite{oorts_building_2014, de_bruyn_enabling_2018}. Furthermore, the applicability of
\gls{ca} has no additional or negative effect when used in conjunction with the
\gls{ns} Theorems.
