\subsection{Converging the Controller element} \label{converging_controller_element}

The following \ns elements are convergent with the \emph{Controller} element of
\ca. The \emph{Data}, \emph{Task} and \emph{Flow} elements are not convergent as they
do not align in the perspective of structure, intent, purpose and functionality.

        \toprule
        Connector & \someConvergence & The \emph{Controller} and \ns \emph{Connector}
        element are convergent to some degree. Both elements are involved in communication
        between components. The use of the Controller is a bit more strict it strictly
        defines communication from external parts of the systems, involving specific \emph{Interactor}. \\
        \bottomrule
        Trigger & \strongConvergence & The \emph{Controller} and the \emph{Trigger} element of
        \ns are convergent to some degree as they both can initiate actions based on
        external events or requests. A \emph{Controller} can respond to external requests and
        invoking the appropriate interactor. \\
