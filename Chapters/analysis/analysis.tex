\chapter{Analysis results} \label{chap_evaluation}

This chapter will analyze the two development approaches, \gls{ca} and \gls{ns}. We will
examine how these approaches converge and affect software architecture on the Artifact.
First, in Section \ref{sec_converging_principles}, we will compare the principles of
\gls{ca} with the principles of \gls{ns}. Then, we will compare the design elements in
section \ref{sec_converging_elements}. Additionally, we will showcase real-world examples
from the Artifacts to illustrate their practical manifestations.

We will finalize this chapter by analyzing combinatorial effects on the various change
dimensions of the studied artifacts.
