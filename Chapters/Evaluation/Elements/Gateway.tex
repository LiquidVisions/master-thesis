\subsection{Converging the Gateway element}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l | c | p{0.70\linewidth}}
        \toprule
        Data & \noconv &  The Gateway and Data element are not convergent. Nevertheless,
        the Gateway element might interact with data entities when providing access to
        external resources or systems.\\ \midrule

        Task & \noconv &  The Gateway and Task element are not convergent. Nevertheless,
        the Task elements might use gateways when interacting with external resources or systems
        during the execution of business logic.\\ \midrule
        
        Flow & \noconv & The Gateway and Flow element are not directly related, as the Flow
        element represents the orchestration between Tasks in \gls{ns}, whilst the Gateway
        element in \gls{ca} provide access to external resources or systems.\\ \midrule
        
        Connector & \conv & The Gateway and Connector element have a strong convergence, as both
        are involved in communication between components and provide interfaces for
        accessing external resources or systems.\\ \midrule
        
        Trigger & \noconv & The Gateway and Trigger element are not convergent, as the
        Trigger in \gls{ns} is about event-based execution of Tasks, whilst the Gateway in
        \gls{ca} provide access to external resources or systems.\\ \bottomrule
