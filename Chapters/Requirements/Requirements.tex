\chapter{Requirements} \label{chap_requirements} 

In this chapter, we will explain that the artifact requirements are composed of two
distinct parts. The research aims to examine the level of convergence between \gls{ca} and
\gls{ns}. As such, the design and architecture requirements are intentionally, and entirely 
based on the principles and design approach of \gls{ca}. A full description of this requirement
can be found in section \ref{sec_artifact_requirements}. In order to analyze the level of
convergence, the artifacts need to comply with the evolvability requirements of the theory
of \gls{ns}, described in section \ref{sec_research_requirements} of this chapter.
