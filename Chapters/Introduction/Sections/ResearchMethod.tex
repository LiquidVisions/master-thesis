\section{Research method} \label{sec:research_method}

The research within this thesis relies on the Design Science Methodology according to
\citeauthor*{wieringa_design_2014-1}. The research objectives and questions described in
chapters \ref{sec:research_objectives} and \ref*{sec:research_questions} clearly define a
design problem. The engineering cycle provides a structured approach to develop the
required artifacts in order to analyze the design problem.
