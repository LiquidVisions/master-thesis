\section{On stability} \label{sec:on_stability}

In several scientific fields stability is defined as \gls{bibo} and is considered a
fundamental property of a system. In the context of \gls{ns}, stability is an important
property of the (software) artifact. It is stated that, in general, stability comes down to
the fact that the (software) artifact is not excessively sensitive for small changes
