\subsection{The Interactor Element}

\evaluateElementTable{Interactor}{tab_convergence_interactor}{ \addEvalRow{Data &
    \noConvergence &  There is no convergence between the Interactor element of \gls{ca} and
    the Data element of \gls{ns} and no manifestations are found in the Artifact.}

    \addEvalRow{Task & \fullConvergence &  The Interactor element of \gls{ca} has a strong
    convergence with the Task element of \gls{ns}, as both encapsulate the execution
    of business rules. This is illustrated in Code Listing \ref{list_interactor_task}
    which converges with an implementation of a Task, having a single execution of a business
    rule \parencite{koks_createentityvalidator_2023}. }

    \addEvalRow{Flow & \fullConvergence & The Interactor has a strong convergence with the
        Flow element of \gls{ns} as the both elements can orchestrates the flow of execution for
        a use case, which can involve multiple Tasks in \gls{ns}. This is clearly
        illustrated in Code Listing \ref{list_interactor_flow}, where the Interactor
        handles Validation, mapping and persistance of the Entity \parencite*{koks_createentityinteractor_2023}. }

    \addEvalRow{Connector & \noConvergence & There is no convergence between the Interactor
    element of \gls{ca} and the Connector element of \gls{ns} and no manifestations are
    found in the Artifact.}
    
    \addEvalRow{Trigger & \noConvergence & There is no convergence between the Interactor
    element of \gls{ca} and the Trigger element of \gls{ns} and no manifestations are
    found in the Artifact.} }
