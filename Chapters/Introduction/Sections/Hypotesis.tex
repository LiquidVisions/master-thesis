\section{Hypothesis} \label{hypothesis} 

The proposed hypothesis is that the Clean Architecture approach can be applied in
conjunction with the Normalized Systems theorems. The design principles of Clean
Architecture converges with the theorems of Normalized Systems. Consequently, the artifact
that is part of this design research will lead to a highly modular, stable and evolvable
C\# artifact and does not contradict the theorems of Normalized Systems.

Both architectural approaches formulate their modular structures independent of any given
programming technology \parencite[]{mannaert_normalized_2009,robert_c_martin_clean_2018}. As such,
the C\# artifact produced as part of this research has similar trademarks of modularity,
evolvability and stability, compared to case studies where Java SE has been used.
\parencites[]{oorts_building_2014, de_bruyn_enabling_2018}. The applicability of Clean
Architecture has no additional or negative effect.
