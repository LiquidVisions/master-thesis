\section{Normalized Systems: Impacting software stability} \label{ns_theory}

\gls{ns} is a software development approach that prioritizes achieving software stability
through the use of standardized, modular components and interfaces. This theory is
informed by several scientific disciplines, including systems theory, mathematics, and
computer science, as well as some other software development approaches such as agile
development and domain-driven design.

\gls{ns} originated in the field of software engineering. However, the underlying theory
of \gls{ns} can be applied to various other domains, such as Enterprise Engineering,
Business Process Modeling, and document management. This research acknowledges the
software engineering background of gls{ns}. It consistently refers to software and
Information Systems when referring to \enquote*{artifacts}. However, the reader should
realize that the concepts and artifacts are not restricted to software artifacts alone.
