\section{Normalized Systems Theory} \label{sec_ns_theory}

\gls{ns} is a software development approach prioritizes achieving software stability
through standardized, modular components and interfaces. This Theory is informed by
several scientific disciplines, including systems theory, mathematics, and computer
science, as well as some other software development approaches, such as agile development
and domain-driven design. This thesis acknowledges the software engineering background of
\gls{ns}. It consistently refers to software and Information Systems as
\enquote{artifacts.} However, the underlying Theory of NS can be applied to various other
domains, such as Enterprise Engineering \parencite{huysmans_towards_2013}, Business
Process Modeling \parencite{nuel_towards_2011}, and the application in TCP-IP based
firewall rule base \parencite{haerens_evolvability_2021}, emphasizing the impact of
\gls{ns} Theory. In the following sections, we will quote all aspects of NS Theory that
impacted the artifacts, their analysis, or conclusions of this research.
