\subsection{Converging the Presenter element}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l | c | p{0.70\linewidth}}
        \toprule
        Data & \noconv &  The Presenter and Data element are not convergent. However, Data
        elements might be transformed into a suitable format for the user inter interface
        by \gls{ca}'s Presenter element. \\ \midrule

        Task & \noconv &  The Presenter and Task elements are not convergent. The
        Presenter element is focused on transforming output data to the user interface,
        while the Task element of \gls{ns} executes business logic.\\ \midrule
        
        Flow & \noconv & The Presenter and Flow element are not convergent. The Flow
        element of \gls{ns} represents the orchestration between Tasks, while the
        Presenter element in \gls{ca} is responsible for transforming output data to the
        user interface.\\ \midrule
        
        Connector & \noconv & The Presenter and Connector elements are not convergent.
        Although the Presenter element of \gls{ca} might rely on Connector elements of
        \gls{ns} to communicate with other components in the system.\\ \midrule
        
        Trigger & \noconv & The Presenter and Trigger elements are not convergent, as the
        Triggers element in \gls{ns} is about event-based execution of Tasks, while
        presenters in \gls{ca} are responsible for transforming output data on behalf of
        the user interface.\\ \bottomrule
