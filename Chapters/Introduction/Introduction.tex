\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}

\enquote{\emph{Pantha Rhei}} is, according to \emph{Plato}, one of the famous
philosophical statements first described by the Greek philosopher
\emph{Heraclitus}\footnote{\url{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/}}.
His statement unambiguously describes the dynamics of everything that exists. The
\enquote{flux of life} is one of the constants in life and can be applied to contemporary
corporate environments where change is continuously introduced at an ever-increasing pace.
These changes lead to an evolution of requirements impacting the evolvability,
maintainability and quality of Software artifacts.

The \enquote{laws of software evolution} \parencite[]{lehman_programs_1980} refers to a
series of laws that have a deteriorating effect on the evolvability of software.
\citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980} describes the balance between the forces driving new
requirements on the one hand, and the forces that slow down progress on the other hand.
Changing software leads to deterioration of the maintainability, impacting the
evolvability and possibly also the quality of these software systems. More than a half of
century of software engineering-, and architecture practices show that the complexity of
these software artifacts gradually increases over time. Eventually, this will render most
of the software artifacts obsolete, according to \citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980}
\parencite[]{lehman_programs_1980}.

Over time there have been many attempts to solve the deterioration of Software Artifact,
some of which with scientific backgrounds. Even before the publication of
\citeauthor{lehman_programs_1980} laws of evolution, McIlroy proposed a vision where
the systematic reuse of software building blocks leads to negative programming practices
where software changes eventually lead to a reduction of complexity. Parnas continued with
the principle of information hiding that is the foundation of modular software architectures
