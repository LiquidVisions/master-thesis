\subsection{Converging the Entity element}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{ l | c | p{0.70\linewidth}}
        \toprule
        Data & \partconv & Both elements represent data objects that are part of the
        ontology or data schema of the application, and typically include attributes and
        relationship information. While both can contain a full set of attributes and
        relationships, the Data entity of \gls{ns} may also include a specific set of
        information that is required for a single task or use case. \\ \midrule

        Task & \noconv & The Entity is not convergent with the Task
        element of \gls{ns}. However, the Tasks element might operate on entities to
        perform business logic. \\ \midrule

        Flow & \noconv & The Entity and Flow are not convergent, as the Flow element
        represents the control between Tasks in \gls{ns}, while the Entity in \gls{ca}
        represents domain objects.\\ \midrule
        
        Connector & \noconv & The Entity element and Connector element are not
        convergent, as the Connector element in \gls{ns} is involved in between components,
        while the Entity in \gls{ca} represents domain objects.\\ \midrule
        
        Trigger & \noconv & The Entity element and Trigger element are not convergent,
        as the Trigger element in \gls{ns} is about event-based execution of Tasks, while
        the Entity in \gls{ca} represents domain objects.\\ \bottomrule
