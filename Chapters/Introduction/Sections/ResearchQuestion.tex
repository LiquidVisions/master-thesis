\section{Research questions} \label{sec:research_questions}
The Hypothesis described in \ref{hypothesis} and \ref{research_model} leads us to the
following research question:

\begin{center}
    \enquote*{\textit{To what extent converges the modularity, stability and evolvability
    of a software artifact built based on Clean Architecture toward a
    similar results by the Normalized Systems Theorems?}}
\end{center}

The following sub-questions can be formulated that support the research on the main
research question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the Normalized Systems Design Theorems
    \item What are the Clean Architecture design principles
    \item How does software generation contributes to the modularity, stability and
    evolvability of a Clean Architecture expander
\end{itemize}
