\section{Introducing Clean Architecture}

Clean Architecture is the accumulation of more than half a century of coding, designing,
and architecting software systems by Martin, Robert C. He published experience in his book
\citetitle*[]{martin_clean_2018} in \citeyear[]{martin_clean_2018}. He states that
creating a programming artifact does not require much skill and knowledge. However, creating
stable and evolvable software artifacts is a different skill that requires
a lot of knowledge, skill, dedication, and time.

The book's goal is to have a software architecture that minimizes the human resources
required to build and maintain the information system. Just like Normalized Systems, it
has a prescribed design of software classes that will lead to a modular architecture with
low coupling and high cohesion \parencite{martin_clean_2018}.
