\subsection{Component Architecture Requirements}
 
The following requirements are applied to the Component Architecture of both the Generator
Artifact and the Generated Artifact.

    The solution is organized into separate Visual Studio projects for the Domain,
    Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers of the component. A detailed
    description of these layers can be found in Section \fullref{subsec_layers}.
    \\
    The Visual Studio projects representing the component layers comply with the naming
    conventions outlined in the appendix \fullref{appendix_component_naming_convention} \\
       
    The dependencies between the component layers must follow an inward direction towards
    the higher-level components as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig_modulair_components}
    schematically, and cannot skip layers. \\

    \hline
       The Domain and Application layers have no dependencies on any infrastructure technologies, like web- or database
       technologies. 
       \\
       The Presentation Layer relies on various infrastructure technologies for
       facilitating end-user interaction. Examples of such technologies include Command
       Line Interfaces (CLIs), RESTful APIs, and web-based solutions. Each dependency is
       isolated and managed in separate Visual Studio Projects to ensure the stability and
       evolvability of the system. 
       \\
       The Infrastructure Layer may rely on other infrastructure components, such
       as databases or filesystems. Each infrastructure dependency is isolated and managed
       in separate Visual Studio Projects to promote stability and evolvability. 
       \\
       All Component Layers utilize the C\# programming languages, explicitly targeting
       the .NET 7.0 framework. 
       \\
       Reusing existing functionality or technology (packages) is permitted only when
       adhering to the \gls{lsp} and utilizing the open-source package manager, \gls{nuget}.
