\section{Research question} \label{sec:research_questions}
In order to test the hypothesis described in \ref{hypothesis} the following research
questions can be applied to both research objectives.

\subsubsection*{Research Question 1:}
What violations of the Normalized Systems Theorems can be found as an effect of
following the Clean Architecture principles on both the expander- and expanded artifact?

\subsubsection*{Research Question 2:}
Which of the Normalized Systems Theorems are excluded as an effect of following the
Clean Architecture principles on both the expander- and expanded artifact?

When no violations or excludes on the Normalized Systems Principles are found in the
artifacts, it is assumed that there will be no combinatorial ripple effect on changing
both artifacts. Only in that case, it can be concluded that Clean Architecture can be
used in conjunction with the Normalized Systems theorems.
