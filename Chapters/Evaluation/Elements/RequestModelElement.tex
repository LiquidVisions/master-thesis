\subsection{Converging the RequestModel element} \label{converging_requestmodel_element}

The following \gls{ns} elements are convergent with the RequestModel element of
\gls{ca}. The Task, Flow, Connector and Trigger elements are in no way convergent as they
differ in the perspective of structure, intent, purpose and functionality.

        Data & \supports & The RequestModel and \gls{ns} Data element
        convergent to some degree. Both are involved in defining the structure of data
        used in the system. This includes required information about attributes and
        relationships. RequestModels represent input data for a specific interactor and
        will most likely contain only the information that is needed for that specific use
        case. The RequestModel could also carry non Data element specific information that
        is required to execute the use case.\\
